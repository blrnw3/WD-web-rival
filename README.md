nw3weather

A web-based system for the aggregation, management and public visulation of data from 
my weather station in Hampstead nw3, North London.

The back end is entirely written in PHP.

Each major version has its own directory due to the vast architectural differences between them.

In theory, the newest version (v4), will be more portable and applicable to a wider audience.
