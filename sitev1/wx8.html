<h3>About the Weather Station</h3>
<p><b>Technical:</b> I am operating an Oregon Scientific WMR-200 and using Weather Display software to collect the data in real time,
which is then broadcast to this website. The Home page updates every minute; any live data and graphs have an update frequency
 of 5 or 10 minutes unless specified;
most other pages are refreshed every hour. The exceptions are the webcam, which updates every minute, and any 
pages with static content like the photo page, which is not automatically updated.
In general these uploads occur with a delay of between 10 and 80 seconds. The full schedule can be found
 <a href="WDuploadtimetable.xls" title="Weather Display upload schedule and history">here.</a>
It is, however, important to note that these updates will not always be carried out - software glitches,
internet connection losses and internet crashes can and do happen! Thankfully the WMR-200 has an onboard data logger,
 so most, if not all data can be recovered in case of a computer crash.</p>

<p><b>Accuracy</b>: The data comes from a personal automatic weather station (PWS/AWS) so there can be no guarantees of accuracy or reliability,
and the data is not immediately quality controlled, but the setup shown below is designed to provide the most accurate readings possible.
For temperature and humidity readings this means shielding the sensors from <acronym title="incident solar radiation">insolation</acronym> and providing them with good airflow;
for rain data the sensor needs to be in as open a place as possible to avoid rain shadow, but not too open since a high wind can cause problems;
and for wind readings the sensors should be 10m above ground and clear from obstructions (to provide a 'clean' flow of air).
In an urban environment these conditions are difficult to meet, and this must be considered when using data from such sites,
especially when comparing them to non-urban sites. 
A more in-depth guide to siting weather stations can be found <a href="http://www.weatherstations.co.uk/gooddata.htm" title="Optimal siting of a PWS">here.</a> </p>
<p> It should also be noted that at no point do I quote figures for the errors associated with my readings, though of course they technically do exist.
This is partly due to conventions in displaying weather data, but also because it can be very difficult to ascertain such values, especially for urban sites:
 For a given sensor the errors can vary widely from day to day and are sensitive to quite specific factors. 
All I can say is that I have tried to minimise errors where possible, but some large errors may well exist,
 and where possible I have attempted to highlight these in my personal data sets (found <a href=wx4.html#bottom title="See spreadsheets section">here</a>).



<p><b>A note on forecasting:</b> The accuracy of the local forecast on the home page is considered to be low, since it is based entirely on pressure
trends - falling pressure means cloud, and if it continues to fall, then rain;
 rising pressure signals sunny intervals then clear conditions. This is obviously very simplistic. The forecasting
done by national meteorological offices requires the amassing of a huge amount of data from observation sites on land, 
on the sea, in the air and even from satellites in space. The data is then fed through supercomputers running numerical models
that supposedly represent science's current best view of extremely complex atmospheric processes.
The model outputs then need processing and interpreting before a forecast is produced.
The whole operation costs many millions of pounds to set up and run. Barometric prediction, on the other, is very cheap but has
severe limitations: it cannot offer regional guidance, it is only relevant for the next 24 hours or so, and it breaks down
completely in more complex atmospheric set-ups.</p>

<p><b>Extra Info:</b> Every 30 minutes the software downloads the latest weather report, a <acronym title="aviation routine weather report"> METAR</acronym>
 from the nearest airport, Heathrow;
this provides the cloud reports information found on the home page.
 It is also useful for checking the reliability of my own readings from this <acronym title="personal weather station">PWS</acronym>. 
Incidentally, the data gathered at airports, both commercial and military, around the world is a key component to the information needed by forecasting models,
which form the basis of modern weather forecasting.</p>

The station co-ordinates are approx. 51.556, -0.155, which is ~60m (200ft) above mean sea level.
<br><br>
<h3>Setup</h3>
The station comprises several sensors: a combined thermometer/hygrometer housed in a home-built Stevenson Screen (a radiation shield);
<br> a combined anemometer & wind vane, located atop a 6m pole attached to the chimney of the house;
<br> a self-tipping rain gauge modified to a resolution of 0.3mm, which is attached to the roof of the Stevenson Screen;
<br>and a barometer integrated into the receiving unit (indoors).<br><br>

<br>All the sensors are automatic and send data wirelessly to the receiving unit every 14-60s.<br><br>

<br>

<h3>History</h3>
I started collecting data at this site on 28th July 2010. Prior to that I had been running the same setup in East Finchley, a town 5Km north of here, since February 2009,
but I have kept temperature records since March 2008.
Consequently, any records from before July 2010 are for East Finchley, though given the small distance involved, any data comparisons are perfectly valid.
However, there is one period which is an exception to this - from 17th April to 27th July 2010 the AWS was on a temporary site
in Finchley Central (~1km from East Finchley). This site was smaller and had more obstructions. Consequently I am not confident
in the accuracy of the maximum temperatures for this period - I believe them to be a little inflated (especially on sunny days).
Also, The rain gauge had more of a rain-shadow and so probably under recorded to some extent. Furthermore, I collected absolutely no
wind records for this period - I instead used the data from the METARs of Heathrow, which reports higher wind speeds due
to its greater exposure and better equipment. 
<p> I added a webcam (Logitech C300) to the station on 1st August 2010. This provides the latest and historical webcam images, as well as all the timelapses.
Another webcam was added on 19th December 2010 - this one is positioned to overlook the ground, so that snow cover and fog can be observed.</p>

<p><b>Technical history:</b><ul>
<li type="disc">The rain gauge was modified in March 2009 - the original had a resolution of only 1mm.
This involved fitting a funnel to the collecting channel so that less rain is needed to cause a 'tip' in the internal bucket
(each tip results in a signal being sent to the receiving unit, which registers the rain).</li>
<li type="disc"> In July 2009 I built the radiation shield for the temp/hum sensor to improve the accuracy of the readings:
The walls are double louvred hardwood, the roof is double insulated plywood with a cavity for air flow, and
the whole thing is painted in white gloss. Maintenance is carried out twice a year, mainly to keep the paint glossy.</li>
<li type="disc">The combined wind sensor unit was mounted on a 6.1m aluminium-alloy aerial pole in August 2009.</li></ul>
   
<br>
<h3>Website</h3>
<p>The site was developed, and is therefore best viewed, in Firefox and on a widescreen display, but other browsers and aspect ratios have been tested and found to display most things correctly.
<br>I built the website in early September 2010, and it launched in a testing stage on 10th September 2010. This ended on the 20th September, but
some new content is still being added, and changes are occasionally made to some of the pages.</p>

<p>On 8th December 2010, a new home page was designed and uploaded. The old version can be found <a href=wx16.html title="It still updates"> here</a>. 

<p><b>Technical:</b> The CSS template, and some of the HTML code, is sourced from 
<a href="http://www.carterlake.org/webtemplates.php" title="Weather Display Templates">carterlake.org</a>, though I have written most of these myself.
<br>The live data is automatically generated using Weather Display tags
(see <a href="wx9.html" title="Useful Links">links</a> page).
These convert the data from the software (Weather Display) to readable information on this site.
<br> The process involved in converting readings from the sensors to the data viewable on this website can be summarised thus: <br>
<a href="http://nw3weather.co.uk/Sensors to WWW.jpg"><img src="http://nw3weather.co.uk/Sensors to WWW3.jpg" alt="Data flow chart" title="Click for full-size image" width="589" height="318" border="0"></img></a> 
<br> Each sensor wireless sends data to the base station, which renders this data and transmits it to my home PC (a dedicated low-power machine running Windows 7).
Weather Display software displays this data, and at every specified upload time, converts the tags in the locally-written files to viewable information.
It then uploads the newly generated HTML files via FTP (file transfer protocol) to my hosting server - <a href="http://orchardhosting.com/" title="External Link">Orchard Hosting</a> - 
which broadcasts the web pages to the World Wide Web for anyone with an internet connection and web browser to view.
