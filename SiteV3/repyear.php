	<h1>Brief Annual Summaries (2014-)</h1>

			<h2>Year 2017 - warm spring, wet summer, snow returns</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" id="report-2017">
<p>
	2017 was the ninth year of records for this weather station, and the seventh complete year in its current location in nw3. <br />
	On the whole, it was another warm year, with average rain and sun. <br />
	The big news this year was that I completely replaced the weather station with an upgraded model: A Davis VP2, in early Sept. So far it's been working great!<br />

	<br />
	Weather Highlights:
	<ul>
		<li>Exceptional and extended Spring warmth: From late Feb to late Jun the mean temperature was 2.5C above the long-term average</li>
		<li>June was the warmest ever, and included a record 5 day spell of maximum temperatures above 30C</li>
		<li>For the 2nd year running, no month was more than 0.5C below average</li>
		<li>Bone-dry April: Bested only by April 2011's 2mm, the 3mm in April '17 is our 2nd driest month ever, and just 6% of the expected total</li>
		<li>Wet summer: Average rainfall for May-Aug was 56% above average (mostly due to several big falls). A welcome change after April</li>
		<li>Interestingly, the year had only 145 days with measurable rain, a record low, despite the total rain being 6% above avg</li>
		<li>Sunny January: Fourth year in a row above average, and included 4 days having their maximum possible sunshine</li>
		<li>On the 10th Dec we had our first substantial snow in five years, with a nice 4cm covering.</li>
	</ul>

			<h2>Year 2016</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" id="report-2016">
<p>
	2016 was the eighth year of records for this weather station, and the sixth complete year in its current location in nw3.<br />
	Highlights:
	<ul>
		<li>December rainfall: 81% below average, third driest month on record, and first time the driest month of the year was a winter month</li>
		<li>Very wet, stormy, dull June - 67% up on rain, and just half the expected sunshine. 7 days had thunder, a record</li>
		<li>Winter sunshine: Jan, Feb, Dec and Nov were all sunnier than average</li>
		<li>Foggy December: 7 days, a record (previous was 3 in Nov' 11), helping achieve a record year with 10 foggy days</li>
		<li>Late April cold: The last week of April was > 3C below avg and had a couple of snow showers (the latest seen at nw3weather)</li>
		<li>Anomalous overall warmth: 7 out of 12 months were > 1C above avg, and the lowest anomaly was just -0.5C (a record)</li>
		<li>September was warmer than June, and only a degree cooler than Jul/Aug, followed by a 6 deg drop into Oct</li>

	The weather station itself had a bad year, the wind sensor failing in early Feb (not yet fixed), and multiple
	outages of the thermo/hygro sensor (ranging from a few hours to a few days); indeed this was replaced in late Sep.
	This coming year I plan to replace the entire weather station, probably in September.

		<h2>Year 2015</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" id="report-2015">
<p>
	2015 was the seventh year of records for this weather station, and the fifth complete year in its current location in nw3.<br />
	Generally unremarkable when averaged over the entire year (temperature +1.1C, rain -5%, sun -2%), 2015
	will nonetheless be remembered for its quite spectacular December. The heights reached by the daily night and day
	temperatures are impressive enough, but most remarkable and unusual was the sheer persistence of the warmth:
	<ul>
		<li>Mean temperature, 11.5C (10C by night, 13C by day)... +6C above the LTA average of 5.5C</li>
		<li>Highest temperature by day: 16.0C (winter month record)</li>
		<li>Highest temperature by night: 14.1C (record for any month between Dec-Apr)</li>
		<li>EVERY day hit at least 10C (consider that the AVERAGE December high is only 7.8C)</li>
		<li>NO night fell below 4.7C (the AVERAGE December low is 3.2C)</li>
		<li>The previous December record for mean temp of 7.1C was bested by over 4C</li>
		<li>Five years ago the mean temp was 1.3C, 10C lower than this year</li>
		<li>The mean overnight temperature, 10C, was higher than ANY May month on record</li>
		<li>All but two of the 20 highest December temperatures in the last seven years, and all of the top 13, came in 2015 </li>
		<li>It was significantly the most anomalous for temperature in 84 months on record, at +6.0C. Previous record was +4.7C in Apr 2011</li>
	</ul>
	It's perhaps hard to justify the hype when the record spans only seven years, but the 367-year CET (Central England)
	series reproduces these results: it had its <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcet/mly_cet_mean_sort.txt">warmest December on record</a>,
	besting its previous result by 1.6C. It was also warmer than 366 out of 367 past Novembers.
</p>
<p>
	Also worth a note is the wind speed, which averaged over the year was the highest on record.
	December also recorded the strongest monthly mean speed for any month at 7.8 mph.
	June gets a mention for having only 9mm of rain, the second driest on record after April 2011's 2mm.
	April was the sunniest month of the year. And July 1st recorded the highest temp on the record, 34C.
</p>
<p>
	For the website, nw3weather again saw its busiest year since launching in Sep 2010, with 84,000 visits (up from 75,000 in 2014),
	giving a mean figure of 231 per-day. The median was 210, since busy days (commonly very wet, windy, hot or cold days) skew the figure.
	The most in a single day was 679 on <a href="/wxhistday.php?year=2015&month=7&day=1" title="">1st July</a>,
	the hottest day in nw3weather history. The fewest was 116 on 17th Oct, a quiet Saturday (which is generally the quietest day of the week).
	2015 also saw the introduction of the nw3weather twitter feed, a way for me to share crazy (and mundane) statistics from the data I record.

	<h2>Year 2014</h2>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;" id="report-2014">
<p>
	2014 was the sixth year of records for this weather station, and the fourth complete year in its current location in nw3.<br />
	It was the wettest of these, with a 31% excess compared to the expected long-term climatic average.
	Five of the top-ten wettest days across all six years fell in 2014's Aug-Nov period alone, which also contains the
	overall wettest day, the 13th Oct 2014, with 41 mm.
	For the first time, more than half of days had some measurable rainfall, whilst January had just <b>one</b> complete dry day all month.
</p>
<p>
	Despite this, 2014 was both the warmest and sunniest in my records.
	The mean temperature was 1.3 C above average (Across England
	<a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcet/data/download.html" title="Hadcet data">the anomaly was similar</a>,
	and moreover 2014 was the warmest year in 357 years of records).
	August was the only month to come in below average, while Jan-Apr all came at least two degrees above.
	For the first time, there was absolutely <b>no</b> snowfall, and the year had the fewest air frosts on record.
</p>
<p>
	For the website, nw3weather saw its busiest year since launching in Sep 2010, with 75,000 visits (up from 63,000 in 2013),
	giving a mean figure of 206 per-day. The median was 188, since busy days (commonly very wet or windy days) skew the figure.
	The most in a single day was 600 on <a href="/wxhistday.php?year=2014&month=2&day=14" title="">14th Feb</a>,
	a wet and extremely windy day (50 mph gusts). The fewest was 106 on 6th Sep, a quiet and overcast Saturday.<br />
	Looking ahead to 2015, this should see the completion of back-end website upgrades, with only minor UI and informational changes.
