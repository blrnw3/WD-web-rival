	. 'Furthermore, with no grassy area, an extremely heavy pot was used to house the shield post instead. '
	. 'Otherwise little modification was required, save for an extra base bracket on the post to accommodate '
	. 'the now-sagging base. The pole for the wind sensor had to cut into two 3m sections to enable transport, '
	. 'and was then re-joined with a special joiny thing before being mounted onto the chimney stack.'
	. ' The whole project took several days, ~£150 (mainly for the pot), and much heavy lifting.'
